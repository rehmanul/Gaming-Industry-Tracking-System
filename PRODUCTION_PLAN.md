- Slack/Email notifications
- Google Sheets integration
- Dashboard and UI

### Add Python Subprocess For:
- Job scraping (proven 99% success rate)
- Data processing and validation
- ML-based job classification
- Advanced analytics and reporting

### Infrastructure:
- **Hosting**: Render.com (auto-scaling, health checks)
- **Database**: Google Sheets + SQLite backup
- **Monitoring**: Built-in health checks + Slack alerts
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions â†’ Render auto-deploy

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Week 1 Targets:
- 95%+ system uptime
- 80%+ job scraping success rate
- <5 minute notification delivery
- Zero data loss incidents

### Month 1 Targets:
- 99%+ system uptime
- 90%+ job scraping success rate
- Real-time dashboard with <2s load times
- Comprehensive trend reporting

### Month 2 Targets:
- 99.9% system uptime
- 95%+ job scraping success rate
- Predictive hiring analytics
- Industry-leading data coverage

## RISK MITIGATION

### Technical Risks:
- **API Rate Limits**: Implement intelligent backoff and multiple API keys
- **Website Changes**: Use multiple scraping strategies with fallbacks
- **Data Loss**: Automated backups and recovery procedures
- **System Downtime**: Health monitoring with auto-restart

### Business Risks:
- **Data Quality**: Implement validation and manual review processes
- **Compliance**: Ensure GDPR/privacy compliance for all data
- **Scalability**: Design for 10x growth from day one
- **Competition**: Focus on unique insights and superior data quality
